# General Information

This is the most important section of this guide, so read each and every bit.

## Stuff to know

- **ID Card is a must, no matter what else you bring**. This is to ensure security in the campus. Also, should you forget to bring your ID Card, you can always show your profile in the PESU App to gain entry to the campus. But you may be stopped and questioned in various places across campus.
- A minimum of 75% of attendance is necessary in every subject to be eligible to write the end sems. Did I say every subject? Yes, attendance is taken subject-wise in universities, not day-wise. Please do remember that.
- You can roam around the campus. There is no restriction on that freedom. As long as you don't break any rules, that is.
- Please do NOT use smartphones during classes. According to new rules, if you're caught, the SIM card and the memory card will be returned and the phone will not be returned till the end of the semester.

## Classes

Here's the timetable for majority of the days in an even semester:

|    **1**    |    **2**     |     **3**     |   **Break**   |     **4**     |     **5**     |     **6**     | **Lunch Break** |     **7**     |     **8**     |     **9**     |
| :---------: | :----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |

In the first hour, there is a pardon of upto 10 minutes, which means you will be allowed into the class until 8:10 during odd semesters or 8:55 during even semesters, after which you might be allowed into the class but without attendance. No pardon for classes after breaks. Note that not every hour may have classes: classes could end at 13:00 or 15:15 during odd semesters or 13:45 or 16:00 during even semesters on some days.

## Stuff you should have

- **A book for notes.** A 5-subject spiral bound book is usually given by the university, so that's more than enough.
- **Blue Book:** A thin, 16-page book (with an obvious blue paper bind) used to write assessments and other lab exams. Costs around ₹10 - ₹12, so buy atleast 2 for each subject.
- **A calculator:** Only a basic-level scientific calculator is allowed. Programmable calculators are not allowed. The most recommended calculators are [Casio FX-991EX](https://www.casio.com/us/scientific-calculators/product.FX-991EX/) or [Casio FX-991CW](https://www.casio.com/us/scientific-calculators/product.FX-991CW/).
