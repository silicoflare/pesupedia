# The AIML Branch

The AIML branch, or rather the CSE (AI&ML) branch is a rather new branch, and is the target of many questions. Therefore, it was valid to dedicate a page to the ABCs of the AIML branch.

It is also to be stressed that it is NOT a specialization branch, as the actual specializations appear in the 3rd year.

## Overview (by an AIML Student)
It is well known that the first year will be the same for all branches of engineering, and that includes AIML too. The main differences start from 3rd semester.


### The 3rd Semester
The 3rd semester in CSE has 5 subjects:
* Digital Design and Computer Organization (DDCO)
* Data Structures and its Application (DSA)
* Statistics for Data Science (SDS)
* Web Technologies (WT)
* Automata, Formal Languages and Logic (AFLL)

Out of these, all remain the same for AIML too, but DDCO is replaced with **System on Chip and Digital Architecture (SDCA)**, which feels like a combo of DDCO and MPCA from the fourth semester. That aside, special topics were the same for both CSE and AIML.

### The 4th Semester
The 4th semester in CSE has 5 subjects:
* Microprocessor and Computer Architecture (MPCA)
* Computer Networks (CN)
* Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)
* Operating Systems (OS)
* Linear Algebra and its Applications (LAA)

Since MPCA is merged into SDCA, it's place is taken by **Big Data (BD)**. LAA gets some extra stuff required for machine learning and is called **Mathematics for Machine Learning (MML)**.

AIML students have a choice to select a special topic from either CSE or AIML. AIML had only one special topic, **Learning from Imbalanced Datasets**.

## Cons of AIML Branch (feat. Rowlet Owl)
<!-- ### Untested Branch
   - The AIML branch is a relatively new offering, with the first batch starting in the 3rd semester.
   - Colleges may have introduced this branch primarily to increase the number of CS seats, as these specialized branches tend to be popular among students.
   - However, it's important to remember that colleges are running a business and may not always prioritize the best interests of the students.
  
### Replacement of Fundamental CS Courses
   - The AIML branch replaces several core, fundamental CS courses with AIML-related content.
   - These core courses are essential for a well-rounded CS education, covering topics like data structures, algorithms, and computer architecture.
   - Replacing these fundamental courses with AIML-specific content may compromise the breadth and depth of your CS knowledge.

### Challenges with Higher Education Admissions
   - Admission boards, particularly for programs abroad, often view specialized branches with skepticism.
   - They are aware that these branches tend to skip fundamental coursework, and they may not consider a specialization in undergrad to be as valuable as a more comprehensive CS degree.
   - Additionally, many admission requirements include specific prerequisite courses that the AIML branch at PES may not cover, which could negatively impact your chances of admission. -->

### AIML as a Mathematical Field
   - AIML is primarily a mathematical field, comprising courses in calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.
   - The advancements in AI and machine learning, such as ChatGPT, are not necessarily engineering marvels, but rather breakthroughs in mathematical techniques and optimization algorithms.
   - If you're not particularly interested in or adept at mathematics, you may find the AIML curriculum challenging and potentially lose interest quickly.

### Research-Oriented Nature of AIML
   - The AIML field is heavily focused on research, with most industry jobs requiring at least a master's degree.
   - As an undergraduate, you may find that the AIML branch limits your options, as you'll be primarily prepared for research-based roles or startups, rather than the broader range of opportunities available to core CS graduates.

### Restricting Exploration
   - The undergraduate years are a crucial time for exploration and discovery within the computer science discipline.
   - By choosing a core CS branch, you'll have the opportunity to explore various subfields, from systems to cybersecurity, and then make an informed decision about your specialization.
   - Restricting yourself to the AIML branch may prevent you from fully experiencing the breadth and depth of the computer science field.

Remember, the key is to carefully consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of the AIML branch, rather than being swayed by its perceived relevance or hype. Prioritize your genuine interests, academic strengths, and long-term career goals when making your decision.
