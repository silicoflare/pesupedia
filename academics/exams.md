# The Examination System
There are three types of examinations/tests held in PES:

## Class Assignments / Lab assignments
Normal assignments of around 20 marks, conducted in the class and written in blue books. 1 assignment is conducted for every unit, and the aggregate marks are considered for the final score.

::: info 
There are no lab exams for Physics or Chemistry. Only for C and Python. In Physics, however, there may be a 30-mark lab MCQ.

## ISA (Internal Semester Assessment)
One of the most important assessments. Conducted in the assessment centre, it is a Computer-Based Test (CBT). 
* There are 2 ISAs each having 2 units, and are for 20 marks, for 30 minutes.
* The timetable will be sent a week before, and the seating allotment is shown in the app on the day of the respective exam.
* Majority of the questions are MCQs and some of them are descriptive, for which the answers can be typed in the PC or written in the booklet.
* You can (usually) leave the exam centre as soon as you finish the exam.

## ESA (End Semester Assessment)
* The final test of your bravery. It is a 100-mark examination for every subject.
* Written in the assessment centres, and seating allotment is given. Spans for 3 hours.
* Completely descriptive. You will be given an answer booklet for the exam. 
* The questions are displayed on the PC, and you can either write the answers or type the answers.
* You can use a combination of both, for example type out an answer and draw a diagram.
* You can't leave the exam hall in the first 45 minutes, and the last 10 minutes of the exam.

::: tip
Make sure to reach in time for the exam, with your hall ticket, because entry is restricted after 30 minutes of commencement of ESA.
